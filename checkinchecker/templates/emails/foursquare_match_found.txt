Hi {{ name }},

Your recent checkin to {{ venue_name }} seems to match something in OpenStreetMap. While you're visiting this place, try collecting these missing attributes for OpenStreetMap:

If you want, you can reply to this email and Ian will make these changes, or you can save your email as a draft/note to yourself for later.

If you'd like to edit the OSM object directly, use this edit link:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?{{ osm_type }}={{ osm_id }}
{% if venue_url %}

You can take a look at the place's website to get more information for editing OSM:
{{ venue_url }}
{% end %}

To remind you where you went, here's a link to your checkin. Remember that you should not copy from external sources (like Foursquare) when editing.
