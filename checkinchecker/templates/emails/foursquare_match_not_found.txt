Hi {{ name }},

You checked in at {{ venue_name }} on Foursquare but that location doesn't seem to exist in OpenStreetMap. You should consider adding it!

In fact, here's a direct link to add the place to OSM using an in-browser editor:
https://poism.dev.openstreetmap.us/add?lat={{ mlat }}&lon={{ mlon }}
{% if venue_url %}

You can take a look at the place's website to get more information for editing OSM:
{{ venue_url }}
{% endif %}

To remind you where you went, here's a link to your checkin. Remember that you should not copy from external sources (like Foursquare) when editing.
